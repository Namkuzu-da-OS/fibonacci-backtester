Chart 14-3 shows the ultra-simple D-Level yearly series on this slice of the southern
California real estate market. With more data, we could include more reaction lows. But,
this is a yearly chart and we're only looking for the major Fibnodes.

The reaction of price back to $170,000 in the early to mid 90s, only met the major .382
Node. Values stayed considerably above the .382 primary Node at $142,420. Where's
the problem? Throughout the early '90s, I encouraged friends, relations, and business
associates to go long Orange County real estate. Very few did - they could not see the
support so apparent to someone schooled in Fibonacci Retracement analysis. This down
move was just a normal correction! Those who took the speculation have some solid
equity now!
It's interesting to note that the low was supported not only by the Node off the Major
Reaction, but also by rental income - in other words, what the house could earn to pay a
typical mortgage. When farm land crashed from inflation's highs, it also returned to an
economically viable level, i.e. what the land could reasonably expect to produce. I didn't
do the analysis, but I would expect the price decreased to the vicinity of the Primary
Node.
Where do we go from here? The reaction down to $170,000 has given us a new place
from which to calculate an expansion. I'll leave it to you to calculate the OP, but that's
where I think we're going, if we can overcome the resistance Nodes (not shown), formed
from the "recent" down leg.
While we're on the subject of long term charts and Major Reactions within the context of
a continuing up trend, let's see the example of the Dow Jones Industrials experiencing a
500 point, one day drop and a multiple week drop of over 1,000 points. Consider the
following D-Level series shown in the FibNodes™ printout on the next page and first
depicted graphically in CHAPTER 11.

We just reacted back to the '*' .382 Node, which was also a Confluence area! Price
stayed within the context of a normal correction.
A QUESTION
Joe, you can always go back in lime and get lower reaction lows! So what's a Primary
Reaction and what isn't?
Part of the answer to your question entails bookkeeping or organization and part of it is
understanding how Time Frame(s) impact your trading decisions.
While it is not true that you can always find lower reaction lows by going back further in
time (the bonds saw their lows in 1981), it is true that by looking at larger Time Frames or
compressing your data, it may be possible to locate deeper retracements than shown on
your (default) screen. Here's how to handle this situation. Pre-calculate a Fibnode series
for all Time Frames above those you are dealing with, as well as the one you are dealing
with. If you are an hourly player for example, have the daily, weekly, and monthly series
organized. That means have a printed copy attached to a clipboard, labeled for that
instrument, and readily available. The charts should be appropriately marked by use of the
divider. You should also have these series as computer files in the software you're using.
(This software should have a "paging" feature to keep your files properly organized).
Each file, as well as each printed chart, can have its own Lineage Markings independent
of (he higher Time Frame files. In our example of the bonds, I would have left the
original FibNodes™ printout BDMOPA2 as it was and I would have had a quarterly or
yearly file, with its own Primary and First Reaction Lineage Markings. The reason that
trading the lower Time Frames is so demanding is because you must know what the Time
Frames higher than those you are trading are telling you. There's a lot to keep up with!
While it is extremely unlikely you'll be reaching a weekly '*'.382 Node when you're
trading a five minute chart, it is not unlikely that an hourly or daily '*'.382 Node will
affect your decisions. Be myopic at your own risk. Don't spend all you time looking for
potholes while simultaneously ignoring the bridge that may be washed out just a little
ahead.
Illustration of the above discussion would require copious examples and a huge amount of
space. It is one of those areas best left to a classroom setting or repeated application by
the individual trader.

MORE MARKET EXAMPLES
A LONG TERM SOYBEAN MEAL TRADE:
Now let's consider a longer term trade in Soybean Meal. The approach outlined can help
you uncover trades that are big winners over a period of months, not just over the next 15
minutes.
GENERAL DISCUSSION:
It's my habit to look over the weekly and monthly continuation charts of about 20 futures
contracts, during the weekend. The markets are closed and I can get an objective,
uncluttered viewpoint. I look primarily for Directional Indicators, major D-Levels, and of
course! also look at the Trend indicators. In addition to determining the Trend, I look to
see if there is acceleration of price, or thrust, through any of the DMAs I use, particularly
the 25X5. If there is, I take notice. Strong thrust through the 25X5 on a continuation
chart, particularly after a quiet period, often signifies a major move is on the way.
CONTEXT:
As I was paging my way through my continuation charts, I saw Chart 15-1 and became
really excited. Here's what caught my attention.

Consider the A, B, C expansion depicted in Chart 15-1 and in the accompanying
FibNodes™ printout. The OP move down was fulfilled and therefore indicated potential
support, almost exactly where it was when I first observed the chart. The potential
support, however, significant as it was, was not strong enough for me to take a position
even though the weekly MACD supported a long entry (Chart 15-3). Adequate context
for the trade was still lacking. There were no signs of up Movement or up thrust.

=== PAGE 267 ===

Chapter 15 More Market Examples 249
I hadn't traded meal since the early 80s. I had all but forgotten it was still traded. When I
looked at this chart a little longer, however, I remembered that meal seasonally bottomed
at about this time of year (March). With the additional consideration of seasonally, there
was enough context for me to want to take a shot at the long side of this market.
TRADE IMPLEMENTATION:
Given the long term nature of the trade, the entry was easy. I would simply enter "at the
market" since I didn't need to worry about getting a few cents off the price. Where to
place the stop was the problem! There was no sign of support, and the XOP was miles
away, so I looked for an alternative approach. While I rarely use option strategies, this
was a natural situation to employ one. Here's what I did. I bought the futures contracts
"at the market" and bought puts against my position to lock in a maximum loss. I made
these trades in the July contract so I would have plenty of time for things to go my way.
For those of you who may be unfamiliar with option strategies, I'll elaborate. The cost of
the put, whose strike price was near the current market price, was essentially the
maximum loss I could sustain. That's because the puts gave me the right to sell contracts
near the price at which I had bought the futures. If the price went up, I would profit on
the futures and cover the puts. If the price went down I would profit on the put options
and make up any loss on the long futures position. This type of strategy is called a "beach
trade." You put it on and go to the beach!

=== PAGE 268 ===

Shortly after I put on the position, we had a Wash and Rinse and then acceleration of price
through the 25X5. See Chart 15-2. The MACD/Stochastic combination shown in Chart
15-3 signaled a buy, so everything was in gear to the up side.
CHART 15-2

Chapter 15 MoreMarket Examples 251
CHART 15-3
Even if you didn't use the more complex option strategy noted above and you knew
nothing about the seasonals, you should have been ready to get on board. Why? Your
attention would have been on the Trend indicators, due to the fulfillment of the weekly
OP. Then, after the Trend signal, the up thrust, arid the Wash arid Rinse, you would have
taken the first opportunity to enter.
Let's look at daily July meal Chart 15-4. We're at the same date as pictured in the weekly
chart above. All we've done is reduce the Time Frame to a daily for a more detailed look.
The 3X3 is containing the up thrust, after the acceleration through the 25X5. For clarity,
I've shown only a small portion of the 25X5. To segregate your thinking, I strongly
recommend you never mix Trend indicators and Fibonacci work on the same chart. I'm
breaking this rule in Chart 15-4 however, since the D-Level presentation is simple (only
one Focus and Reaction Number) and I want to economize on space.

=== PAGE 270 ===

252 DiNapoli Levels
CHART 15-4
Where was this first opportunity to enter? Just look at the D-Levels after the acceleration
(or thrust) through the 25x5.
Your entry would be just above the .382 Node. Your stop would be under the .618 Node.
This is entry technique Minesweeper A, i.e. after the OP support and up thrust manifested
on the weekly, you took the first dip to go long. The technique I used was a sophisticated
Bonsai entry, using the context mentioned above, as well as that of seasonal support. My
money stop was the cost of the put options.
Okay, we're long. Now where do we get out? The answer depends on your Time Frame.
This could easily be a weekly-based trade as it started out for me. In that case, you
would go to a weekly chart, and generate an OP as the wave developed. You could use
that OP level as your profit objective. IF you were a daily-based player, you'd go to the
daily chart to generate a daily-based OP. The second of these possibilities is pictured by
the A, B, C move on the daily Chart 15-5 and shown numerically on the FibNodes™
printout below the chart .

As it turned out, the XOP was quickly achieved but there was nothing wrong with the nice
OP profit. Shortly, I will go into detail on why the OP was my choice as an exit, rather
than the XOP. That's right, we don't always get the high!Chanter I5 More Market Examples 253

THE TRADE CONTINUES:
Okay, let's assume we're out at the OP. The D-Level™ series at this point is illustrated
on Chart 15-6 showing an area of Confluence between 16796 and 16950. The
accompanying FibNodes printout represents the D-Levels existing at that point in time.
CHART 15-6
To reenter this move, it would be prudent to wait for a retracement to Confluence,
although I'm sure Hyper Hank would have put an order in at the first retracement 17084.

primary .618 Node at 16580 and handle any break of Confluence in the manner
described under "Advanced_Comments" in the bond Double RePo trade discussed in
CHAPTER 12. Now we're in and ready for the next up move.
Below are two Fibnode expansion series: the Fibnode expansion originating from the low
at 15980 and the second series originating from the low at 16330. Both are valid. See
Chart 15-7A.
So, what do we do with six profit objectives ?
To simplify the discussion, let's consider the second expansion which is producing lower
profit objectives than the first.

CHART 15-7A
We have three profit objectives to choose from. In hindsight, it's obvious the COP would
have been the right choice. It would have been my choice before the fact as well. Here's
why. Remember I was willing to take the OP profit on the first move up from the 15980
level. For the same reason, I would be conservative and take the COP out of this move.
When a market breaks down for weeks and months as Soybean Meal did, it usually has
some difficulty initially coming out of the hole, as overhead supply in cash markets comes
to bear.

=== PAGE 275 ===

Chapter 15 More Market Examples 257
Distant profit objectives are initially difficult to achieve and typically there's a '*'.618
retracement lying somewhere along the line, after the first move up. Later when more
traders and commercials realize the true structure of the move, we can be more aggressive
in what we are willing to take out of the market and have more confidence in doing so.
Now, let's consider the first expansion indicating COP resistance somewhat higher at
17830. For the same reasons as those just cited, I would take the more conservative COP
of the second expansion. There is another reason, as well. Take a look at Chart 15-7B.
CHART 15-7B
In CHAPTER 7, we discussed taking close in profit objectives, when the market was
Overbought. The extreme overbought area represented by the 618.90 Detrended
Oscillator value certainly qualified. That's precisely the situation the market was in as the
COP profit objective was approached by price!

Primary Node, in the form of a retracement down to 16630. Here's where the puts come
off, and long positions can again be established for the OP move to 18410. This OP move
is discernible on both daily and weekly charts. Chart 15-8 and the accompanying
FibNodes printout shows how you arrive at the Fibnode series, while Chart 15-9 shows
the retracement back to 16630, as well as the expansion to 18410.

IMPORTANT POINTS TO NOTE:
Nowhere in this trade am I interested in playing the short side, even though my techniques
indicated pretty good places to take a shot at the short side. Why? The percentages
aren't there. Remember, we're coming out of the hole, after a major weekly OP, a
seasonal low, and thrust through the DMAs. Why fight all that!
ADVANCED COMMENTS:
Trading in hindsight is always easy. Trading decisions based on what you know at the
present time are what count. Reconsider the first OP profit objective at 17050, in light of
what was shown on Chart 15-7B. The maximum Overbought oscillator up to that point
was 315.70. The OP (price) was in that vicinity of overbought when I chose to take a
profit. In hindsight, the market went to roughly double that value, but I didn't know that
it would, even though the context for the trade suggested that it might. Once the previous
oscillator value was achieved, I had an additional reason for getting long this market by
using "Special Applications of the Detrended Oscillator" Strategy 5, in CHAPTER 7.
Later in this example, I was willing to take the COP out at 17614. I was looking at the
new overbought extreme of 618.90, not the old value of 315.70!
Note that my second trade entry just above the top end of Confluence at 16950 was very
close to my initial exit at the 170 area. //; hindsight, I might as well have stayed in! We
don't have the advantage of hindsight, however, when we trade.
The reentry at 16950 was a much safer trade than staying with the position at the 170 area
because of all the reasons cited above.
In trading based on technical analysis, you are concerned with percentages, with the likely
Movement of price, not the value of the price itself. Buying a dip at 500 after a
consolidation may be better than buying a peak at 400 after thrust, because it's safer!
Don't make it hard on yourself. Play the percentages and whistle all the way to the bank.
WAS A MISTAKE MADE?
Even though this was planned as a long term trade that I expected to last for months, I
traded it on a daily basis. I took advantage of daily swings. Was this a Mistake? No, I
don't think so. This market was easy to read and ready "for the pickin's." While I was
actively trading other intraday markets, there was nothing so captivating that I couldn't
take the time to focus on my old friend, meal, for a few minutes each day.

MORE EASY PICKIN'S:
Note: Do you see the Bread & Butter trade represented by the initial thrust up on Chart
15-7A (3X3 not shown)?
Note: The move down from the COP was fast and furious. It looked as though a Double
RePo (sell) was apparent. The time between the first and second penetration bars,
however, was just too wide to qualify and a Look-Alike wasn't enough to motivate me to
sell this market, in light of all the positive factors.

A SHORT TERM S&P TRADE:
I particularly like this S&P example. Maybe it's because of the money I made trading it,
or maybe it's because it's such an illustrative example. One thing's for sure; it's indicative
of the way I've approached trading S&P since 1985. It's the way I like to interact with
volatile markets.
GENERAL DISCUSSION:
First we will consider the context for the trade. Then, we'll examine how trade
psychology and market mechanics play their role. We will go through a step by step
process, showing each aspect of the Trading Plan and how it was implemented for this low
risk, high profit, hit-and-run experience.
TREND:
From the following daily Chart 15-10, you can see we've been above the 25X5 for
months, above the 7X5 for over a week, and it's obvious from the price action that we
have been and are currently above the 3X3 as well. Therefore the daily Trends are all up.
Furthermore, based on the value of the various DMAs, they are likely to remain up
"tomorrow," unless we get a very severe break in price.
