In Chart 11-5C, there are two independent Fibonacci Resistance series i.e., two Focus
Numbers FRl and FR2, each "owning" one Reaction Point. For clarity, only the Fibnodes
for the FRl series are shown. If you think the FR2 series is too small to bother with,
consider that I have not labeled the 11-5 series of charts with a Time Frame. I have made
them small on purpose. If we are looking at a five minute chart, the Nodes created from
the FR2 to 1 wave might be safely ignored, but what if this represented a weekly Time
Frame?
Chart 11-5D shows a support Node that will act as a Logical Profit Objective for a
position on the short side. The .382 Node has been taken out by price and therefore is not
shown. The position of the .618 Node is such that the price is on a LPO right now!
Which of the LPOs we take, will depend on the context of the trade and the criteria we
established for our original entry2.
Here are some context issues to consider when we determine which profit objective to
take.
1. How overbought or oversold are we?
2. Are we in this trade because of a Directional Indicator or a Trend Indicator?
3. Are the higher Time Frame Trends with or against us?
4. Are we about to get a confirmed or unconfirmed Trend signal in a higher time
frame that will support our trade?
5. For intraday traders, we want to know how close we are to the end of the day!
6. Was thrust apparent on the A B leg?
7. Are we nearing our stress point? Newer traders are often more comfortable
with losses than profits. If you feel undue stress because of the level of
profitability, take a close in objective before you act irrationally.
2 Now would be a good time for you to reread the Directional Indicator material in CHAPTER 6 relating
to "Bread & Butter."

MORE ON STOP PLACEMENT:
We'll take a look at an up move, to consider more thoroughly stop placement techniques.
The same reasoning applies equally to down moves.
DiNapoli Levels can have a significant effect on how you place stops, beyond what has
already been discussed. Let's take a look at stop placement behind, against, or in the
vicinity of old market highs or lows.
Have you ever considered why, on one occasion the market blows through an old high like
gangbusters, and on another, the market holds firmly in the vicinity of, but not necessarily
at the old high? Take a look at the following examples.
CHART 11-6
Due to the small extent of the pull back of the B-C leg, the COP would have been
significantly higher than Point B. It therefore would not have presented any resistance in
the vicinity of the previous high at B. If you had a stop in the vicinity of B, and it is
exceeded, you would have stood a good chance of being hit hard, since there was nothing
to stop the market from brisk Movement up.

=== PAGE 203 ===

Chapter II Trading With DiNapoli Levels 185
CHART 11-7
In the situation depicted in Chart 11-7, the protective stop is less likely to be hit, and if it
is, your fill is more likely to be reasonable. You not only have some inherent resistance
from an old market high, but you also have the additional resistance applied from the
COP. This helps the high at B to remain intact.
CHART 11-8
In the situation depicted in Chart 11-8, Point C is slightly higher than a .618 retracement
of the same AB up move. Stop placement should account for the location of the COP and
be placed above the expansion, not just above the preceding high.

=== PAGE 204 ===

186 DiNapoli Levels
In Chart 11-9 below, we see a variation of the same stop placement criteria shown in the
previous charts. In this case, the up leg is forming a COP, just before the previous high,
thereby increasing the chances the previous high will hold.
CHART 11-9
This phenomenon is played out in the weekly U.S. Bond Chart 11-10, as the twin tower,
all-time highs were formed. COP resistance halted a move to new high ground.

PRESENTATION:
At this point in the book, I think it's fitting to digress a minute and discuss the
presentation of the upcoming market examples. This book has been self-published,
because I wanted to control the material. If it is accepted as a useful and competent work,
I'll be very pleased. If it is not, it won't be because an editor who knows nothing about
trading cut the heart out of it. While I have maintained control, such control involves
risks.
Presumably, you're studying this book because you want to find out more about my
trading techniques, or about the specific topics the book deals with. Up to this point, I've
mentioned certain products Coast Investment Software (CIS) offers, primarily as
footnotes. That is as it should be.
The safe way to handle the upcoming examples would be to keep the presentation generic.
The problem with that approach is that it's not the best method to help you learn, nor is it
the best method for me to teach. My work is most efficiently and lucidly taught, if I use
the tools I have developed, so that you can see what I 'm doing The FibNodes™ program
is such a tool. The Proportional Divider previously mentioned is another such tool. These
are both products that CIS offers. You can get around the use of these tools if you
choose to, but my job of teaching the material and your job of learning the material is
made much easier by their inclusion in this book.
The FibNodes program allows the user to represent in a tabular format, the Retracement -
and Expansion points we've been talking about. It also allows for identifying characters
to be associated with the Nodes it creates so Lineage can be established. This feature
bears repeating for two reasons. First, Lineage is a part of the methodology that some of
my students tend to ignore - to their regret. Second, if you choose to use a spreadsheet to
implement the concept, you need to build a Lineage feature into it. The FibNodes
program has other features designed for high intensity data management during the trading
experience and has been designed as a high quality trading tool. The next few pages will
explain the FibNodes program printouts only to the extent that is necessary for you to
most easily understand the way I have developed and use Fibonacci analysis. A list of
the FibNodes program features can be found in Appendix F.

Chapter 11 Trading With DiNapoli Levels 189
FIBNODES™ PRINTOUTS:
For your understanding of the concepts taught in this book, we are utilizing FibNodes
software, DOS version 4.32, from which all printouts are generated. The program can
handle up to 30 Reaction Numbers. Typical printouts will contain three or four Reaction
Numbers. In practice, I seldom use more than 12 per file, since 12 fit conveniently on the
monitor and are reasonable to keep track of. Upon entering any Reaction Point, you can
enter an identifying character (such as '*') after the last digit of the Reaction Number.
This character will be carried through to the Fibnodes associated with the particular
Reaction Point you select.
Charts 11-11, 11-12, and 11-13 illustrate the presentation of data in the FibNodes
program.

Chapter 11 Trading With DiNapoli Levels 191
We have an idealized example of a Market Swing, starting at 225, achieving a high, then
retracing to 540 and thrusting up to 750. User inputs to the FibNodes™ program are 750,
540T, and 225*. They are shown on the left side of the FibNodes printout. The Focus
number 750 is automatically entered for each segment (1 & 2) since Fibnodes within a
series are always created from the same Focus Number to each Reaction Number. Box 1
contains the .382 and .618 retracements between the Focus Number and the first Reaction
Point. Box 2 contains the .382 and .618 retracements between the Focus Number and the
second Reaction Point and so on. Whether the FibNodes file is a support or a resistance
file, .382 Nodes will always be shown at the top of the box, while .618 Nodes will be
shown at the bottom of the box. This is done for two reasons. First, when you are
trading, you want to see the first number which is likely to provide support or resistance in
the current market situation. Second, the form of the printout with the top numbers
always .382 Nodes and the bottom Nodes .618, allow you to easily and quickly pick out
Confluence by comparing top and bottom numbers. If two reactions are close to one
another, they will produce Nodes that are numerically close but both Nodes will be on top
or both will be on the bottom. Therefore they are not areas of Confluence. I always try to
make things as fool proof as possible for my own trading, since stress tends to eat up IQ
faster than multi-tasking eats up computer memory.
You can also enter any variety of identifying characters you choose, to indicate the
Lineage of a given Reaction Point. 'D' can be used for a daily Reaction Point, 'M' for a
major point. Some Reaction Numbers are more significant than others, so the capacity to
enter letters for clarification after the Reaction Point, is of substantial analytical value. In
our idealized example, Reaction 2 is followed by '*' indicating that it is the primary
Reaction Number and T' follows Reaction 1 indicating thrust. These characters are
carried through automatically to the associated Fibnodes by the software.
Finally, naming FibNodes™ files is up to the user but the naming convention I use can help
you to figure out what any example is illustrating . Odd numbered FibNodes file names
are resistance files and even numbered names are support files. You can get other
information as well. In our next example, the Dow file is named DJYR02. DJ is the
instrument, YR the Time Frame, 02 indicates support. If DA was in the name, instead of
YR, it would indicate a Daily file. A five minute FibNodes resistance file of the September
S&P would be named SPU051.
SP - S&P 500
U - September
05 - 5 minute
1 - Resistance

DOW EXAMPLE:
In the Dow example, utilizing the high in 1987 at 27363, I placed an asterisk after the 41
Reaction Point, upon entry into the software, since 41 is the primary reaction low, i.e. the
depression low occurring, of course, after the 1929 market crash. The low in 1957 was
relatively minor, so the small letter 'm' has been inserted to let me know how strong these
Fibnodes are likely to be. The low of 777 in 1982 deserves a capital 'M' since it was a
major point, the beginning of this incredible bull market. You can see the sharp ascent
after the 1080 low up to 2736. Therefore 1080 gets a 'T' for thrust. Thrust Reaction
Numbers are extremely important, for a variety of reasons. The FibNodes printout below
details Fibnode support and shows a clear area of Confluence between the Thrust Fibnode
at 1712 and the Primary F3 Fibnode at 1707. Those of you who were around and trading
during the nearly 1000 points in four day crash and 500 point single day decline, know
just how gut-wrenching this experience was. We had a negative premium of thousands of
points in the S&P cash to futures spread, with no end in sight and suddenly all this was
stopped dead in its tracks at 1706.90, by precalculated Fibnode Confluence support!
THIS WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT!

low theoretical values, as published in some financial newspapers.

FIBNODE™ OBJECTIVE PRINTOUTS:
In addition to providing Retracement Numbers (Nodes) at which to enter trades,
FibNodes provides you with Logical Profit Objectives which we refer to as Objective
Points (OPs). The three targets, or objectives we've been discussing have printouts that
look like this:
CHART 11-16
The numbers on the left side of this printout are the values of the A, B, & C points. The
numbers on the right side of the printout are the calculated Objective Points.
If you see any extensions on the end of FibNode file names (.FIB .OP), don't be confused.
These extensions help the program and therefore the trader to more quickly and easily
locate previously generated files.

AGREEMENT ON THE BOND CONTINUATION:
Now that you're familiar with FibNodes printouts, let's consider an example of Agreement
that nailed a major weekly low in U.S. bonds. We'll look at the same chart of the U.S.
bond market we looked at earlier, but we'll label it in order to determine where likely
support will come in, after the double top at the 122 level.
The area of Agreement between the COP (10528) of the A, B, C and the '*' support
Node of the up move 1 to F, shown on Chart 11-17, held firmly. Subsequently this area
led to a rally in the bonds, from 10528 to a high of 117 a few months later, which was an
approximate .618 retracement of the preceding down move! See Chart 11-18.

HIDDEN D-LEVELS™:
In trading, when everyone knows something, it does no one any good. When you know
something and everyone else finds out about it later, is does you a lot of good! If
everyone believes the stock market or soybeans are going up, they are already long and
that knowledge is factored into the market. If you know the outcome of a report or
otherwise have inside information that is truly significant, then you can position yourself
ahead of time and benefit from those that follow. Such is the case with hidden D-Levels.
Consider Chart 11-19 below. Based on what you have learned so far, label the Focus,
Reaction Numbers, and Fibnodes, before turning the page.
CHART 11-19

Did you include Lineage markings in your labeling? Below is the correct labeling of the
chart in question. For clarity, the Fibnodes are not shown.
CHART 11-19A
Let's go over this Market Swing one label at a time. The Focus Number is the high of the
move. Reaction 1 is the first low preceding the Focus Number. Three bars to the left of
Reaction 1 is a slightly lower low, which could have been included in the labeling as 2m
(for minor). I have omitted this reaction for clarity, since the Nodes it produces would
have almost the same numerical value as those produced by the reaction labeled as
Reaction 1.

=== PAGE 217 ===

Chapter 11 Trading With DiNapoli Levels 199
The second reaction is the top of the gap or the bottom of the bar after the gap. This is a
hidden Reaction Number and it produces Fibnodes other traders will not be aware of.
Fibnode Confluence areas may also be produced which are transparent, even to traders
with knowledge of advanced Fibonacci techniques.
Reaction 3 carries no particular Lineage designation. For clarity, I chose it alone, rather
than including the Reaction 3 bars to the left of it. Reaction 4 is particularly important
since it is ofF a thrust bar. Like 2G, it produces hidden Fibnodes. 4T is more powerful
than 2G, since Thrust Reactions are more significant than Gap Reactions. Reaction 5 has
the small letter 'f' assigned to it to designate 'first.' This particular reaction is important
for its ability to get you in the move There will be more on this in the advanced comments
section coming up shortly. Reaction 6 is the Primary Reaction Number designated '*'.
Try labeling Chart 11-20 before turning the page, with your enhanced knowledge of D-
Level labeling.

Chapter 11 Trading With DiNapoli Levels 201
ADVANCED COMMENTS:
If I'm trading an active market like the S&P, I'll usually insert reaction lows, even if they
are close to one another, and label the lower one (in an up move) with the letter 'm' to
indicate 'minor.' In the course of trading I will enter trades consistent with context of
course, on the higher Fibnodes created, thereby insuring a fill. I observe the 'm' Fibnodes
to determine the strength of the market, i.e. if I am filled and the 'm' Node is not broken,
it indicates more strength than if the 'm' Node is hit or slightly exceeded. Without
adequate software, or if you were only using dividers, including these minor Nodes would
be inadvisable. The time it takes to calculate them and the clutter this presents,
particularly on an intraday basis, would be counterproductive. Lines produced by graphics
software splayed across the screen would be equally counterproductive.
Remember earlier when I discussed the difficulty you would face when you bought or sold
in the right areas? There is great demand for a fill when you are buying at or near the low
point of a dip (DiNapoli, "The X'd Trade".) Using Nodes from a slightly higher Reaction
Number, like 1 or 3 on Chart 11-19A can be invaluable since you need to get a fill to
make any money! These Reaction Numbers produce Fibnodes that will enable you to be
filled ahead of other traders. Mark the Fibnodes on the chart with your dividers if you
don't implicitly understand this. See the more detailed labeling of Chart 11-19 on Chart
11-21.

=== PAGE 220 ===

CHART 11-21
This same reasoning is the basis for my use of the 7f Nodes rather than 8* Nodes, upon
entering orders. The world may be trying to buy at the .382 of 8*. Who knows about, or
considers the .382 of 7f? If you try to be too conservative and buy at the .382 of 8*
instead of just above the .382 of 7f, you 're more likely to get filled only when the Node is
destined to break!
