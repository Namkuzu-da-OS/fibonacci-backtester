According to John Murphy2:
%K = 100 [(C-Ln/(Hn-Ln)]
%D = 100)Hm/Lm)
where:
C is the latest close
Ln is the lowest low for the last n days
Hn is the highest high for the last n days
Hm is the m-day sum of(C-Ln)
Lm is the m-day sum of (Hn-Ln)
FAST STOCHASTIC
According to Perry Kaufman3:
% K same as shown above
%D = (%Kt + %Kt-1}+ %Kt-2) /3 (this a simple ma smoothing)
where:
%Kt is %K for the most recent period

APPENDIX F
ABOUT FibNodes™:
The FibNodes software has been designed to efficiently implement the strategies taught in
DiNapoli Levels. It is exactly the same software I use for my own trading. There are no
changes, no differences, and no secrets. It is used extensively in this country and abroad
by savvy individual traders and money managers alike, who trade everything from Kuala
Lumpur rubber to the S&P.
HOW FibNodes™ WORKS:
FibNodes is data independent. It does not use a data-base or on-line service to develop its
files. You input the pertinent points. The program develops, stores, calculates and
presents the support and resistance levels as described in DiNapoli Levels. If the market
makes a new high or low, or if a new Reaction Number is called for, you add only this
number; the program uses the data already in the file to recalculate all pertinent points.
The presentation includes Lineage, however Confluence is not automatically determined,
since Time Frame and volatility in a given market can account for widely disparate
Confluence locations.
OPERATING SYSTEM:
Currently FibNodes is a DOS program. A Windows/NT version is being considered.
There is little advantage to a Windows version, except for marketing purposes, since the
DOS program is fully functional (in a DOS window) in WIN3.1, WFWG3.11, or WIN95.
We supply documentation on how to display FibNodes in this manner. Of the current
users, about half use the program in a separate computer, while the other half use a DOS
window in the same computer they run their graphics software. I prefer to use a separate
computer. It's really up to you. If you display FibNodes in Windows with your graphics
software, I recommend a 17 to 25 inch monitor so you don't have to squint to see both
your charting software and FibNodes at the same time. Another alternative is to run
multiple monitors, on the same computer, and display FibNodes on one of them.

=== PAGE 305 ===

Appendix 287
FibNodes™ REQUIREMENTS:
Since the FibNodes software is a sophisticated and narrowly defined calculator, its
requirements are minimal, 640K of memory and 1MB of disk space are all that are
necessary for efficient operation. Installation takes a few minutes. The program is
straightforward and easy to operate. Rather than the months it typically takes to figure
out the complicated software packages sold today, you'll be using FibNodes effectively
within an hour. To fully implement all of the program's features will take you some time
however, depending on how often you trade.
Your choice of a graphics program to use with FibNodes is important. If you're trading
instruments like a five minute S&P, your graphics software should have the capability to
resize charts both vertically and horizontally with a minimum of key strokes. Changing
Time Frames should be an effortless event. Cursor access to critical chart locations must
be quick and easy. Your choice of graphics software should also include the capability to
properly calculate continuous contracts. See Appendix I.
Many of my clients want to see an automatic version of FibNodes and I am in discussions
with a number of high quality graphics software vendors to explore this possibility. What
I have in mind with an automatic version is a more efficient method for the user to insert
data into FibNodes. I do not anticipate nor do I expect to be a part of any attempt to
automatically generate FibNodes support and resistance levels directly from a chart,
absent of thought. I've been down this road with the neural network crowd and the
results were not good. Although such a program could easily be sold for a lot of money,
its output, based on what I have seen, would be of minimal value. If this could ever be
done and such software was easily attainable, the functionality and implementation of the
concept could be in question. See CHAPTER 1.
COST:
The price of FibNodes has been reduced from $795 to $295, while its features and
functionality have been increased. The cost of the software does not justify fooling
around with spread sheet programs in an attempt to duplicate what has taken me 10 years
to achieve. Many of FibNodes' advantages are subtle. They were developed for fast-
paced trading and cannot be appreciated until you have worked with the concept and
implemented the strategies over a period of time.

FibNodes™ FEATURES:
The power of the program comes from its ease of use, unique presentation, and
organizational capabilities. Below are some of its features:
• HOT KEYS: virtually all FIBNODE FUNCTIONS can be implemented by a
single key input. There are no complicated command lines and no fussing around
with the mouse.
• PAGING CAPABILITY: You can efficiently access previously created
FIBNODE files by an alphabetized pull down menu or by simply hitting the "+" or
the "-" key.
• RATIO SELECTION: FibNodes defaults to the ratios I use, but you can easily
select and maintain virtually any ratios you find useful. This can also be used as
an excellent research tool.
• DUPLICATE A FILE: This feature allows you to automatically create the same
file with different ratio inputs.
• TOGGLE KEY: By pressing "T" you will instantly see two additional numbered
Fibnode locations at the .5 and .79 ratios.
• 32ND CONVERSION: The program recognizes bond, treasury notes, or muni
bond files and automatically accepts and produces Nodes in 32nds notation.
• COLORED NODES: As a visual aid, Focus and Reaction Numbers are in white,
while the date, time stamp, and ratio selection appear in blue. Support Nodes and
Profit Objectives are shown in Green, while resistance Nodes and Profit Objectives
are shown in Red.
• UPDATING FILES: You can change Focus Numbers by simply pressing "F".
"A" will add while "D" will delete multiple Reaction numbers. You can also
choose where Reaction numbers are to be placed within the series. .

THE OSCILLATOR PREDICTOR™:
Below is an example of how the Oscillator Predictor study works in practice.

=== PAGE 308 ===

290 DiNapoli Levels
CHART AG-2
Now we have a means of capturing profit at extremes in price but, there's a lot more we
can do. We can use this tool to play "what-if" games. The same set of parametric
equations will give us the level of the Detrended Oscillator for any given price, thereby
allowing us to filter a trade as described in Strategy 2, CHAPTER 7. Here's how it would
work in practice. You know the value of the DMA ahead of time, i.e. for tomorrow. You
know price must exceed that value to get an entry signal. Plug the value of the DMA into
the program, using Option 2, Chart A-G1 and you will know ahead of time, the level of
•Overbought and Oversold corresponding to that price level. Now you can make an
informed decision, whether or not you wish to take that trade.

APPENDIX I
CONTINUOUS CONTRACT CREATION:
There are an almost unlimited means of creating continuous contracts from individual
Futures contracts. The following method works best when using the Fibonacci Analysis
techniques taught in this book
Use all available contract months, regardless of volume or open interest considerations.
Include the current months data right up to the last trading day of the contract. Do not
adjust for any gap that may occur when you append the next months contract to the last
day of the current contract. Friday should be considered to be the close for the week,
while the end of the month, regardless of which day it falls on, is considered to be the
close of that month.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Joe DiNapoli is a veteran trader with over 25
years of solid market trading experience He is
also a dogged and thorough researcher, an
internationally recognized lecturer, and a
widely acclaimed author.
Joe's formal education was in electrical
engineering and economics. His informal
education was in "the Bunker", an aptly named
trading room, packed full of computers and
communications equipment, where most of
Joe's early research began
Exhaustive investigations into Displaced Moving Averages, his creation of the proprietary
Oscillator Predictor™, and in particular, Joe's practical and unique method of applying
FIBONACCI ratios to the price axis, makes him one of today's most sought after experts
As registered C.T.A. for over 10 years, Joe has taught his techniques in the major financial
capitals of Europe and Asia, as well as in the United States. In 1996 alone Mr. DiNapoli
held workshops to capacity audiences in 23 financial centers around the globe. His
contributions have appeared in a wide variety of trading books and technical analysis
publications.
When Chuck LeBeau asked his readers for names of successful traders they most wanted
interviewed, Joe DiNapoli came up more often than any other. Likewise the "Atlanta
Constitution" cited Joe's work by referring to the "magical power" of Fibonacci ratios in
the market place. Joe has used this magic time and again on national TV to make both
startling and uncannily accurate market predictions, particularly in stock market indexes
and interest rate futures.
As president of Coast Investment Software, Inc., located on Siesta Key in Sarasota,
Florida, Joe continues to develop and deploy "high accuracy" trading methods, using a
combination of leading and lagging indicators in unique and innovative ways. He conducts
a limited number of private tutorials each year at his trading room and he also makes his
trading approach available to others via software and Trading Course materials
