Before we go to the next step, I want to digress for a moment to explain the numbered
printouts associated with this chart1. To begin with, the chart was printed as of "last
night's close," the day before the trade took place. The group of numbers below the chart
shows the Oscillator Predictor™ values at various prices. We are most interested in the
maximum Overbought and maximum Oversold levels.

=== PAGE 282 ===

264 DiNapoli Levels
A price of 52849 would produce an "historically" maximum Overbought level of
+100.2139. The abbreviation used for this is Q+max . "Historically" refers to the last six
months. The maximum Oversold level would be achieved at a price of 49990, which is a
Detrended Oscillator value of -144.8575. If you don't have the Oscillator Predictor, you
can use alternative methods described in CHAPTER 7.
OVERBOUGHT AND OVERSOLD ANALYSIS:
If you take the three peaks of the Detrended Oscillator and average them together (86.57
+ 100.20 +77.57, divided by three), you get 88.11. I typically eyeball the values and
estimate an average. Let's use 90. The Oscillator Predictor point shown in Appendix Q
for this value produces a price of 52730. Conclusion: this contract is going to be at a
maximum stretching point tomorrow, if it achieves a price anywhere between 52730 and
52849. As of the close (last night), we were at about 62% of maximum Overbought, so
this number was high enough to bear watching.
DIRECTION:
I don't see any obvious Directional Indicators in play, with the possible exception of
Stretch. What I mean is that when I looked at this chart on the night before the trade took
place, I concluded that there were no Double RePos, RR tracks, Head and Shoulders,
Failures etc., but that it was possible we could end up with a Stretch before tomorrow's
action was over, since we were approaching Overbought. I hadn't calculated any
expansions to the upside, or resistance Fibnodes, so I wasn't sure if Stretch was a real
possibility. Nonetheless, this was duly noted and attached to my S&P clipboard.

TRADE IMPLEMENTATION:
The next morning the market opened strongly by gapping up, then it made a nice .382
retracement back to the 52230 level and continued on to the upside. You can see this by
skipping ahead to the five minute Chart 15-16. Given the context, the only possibility
early in the day was to play this market to the upside.
Look at the MACD/Stochastic on the daily, hourly, and half-hourly charts. They all
pointed up until at least 13:00.
CHART 15-11

=== PAGE 284 ===

CHART 15-13
The problem with taking a long position, however, was that price was reaching very high
Overbought levels. Therefore the risk that it would not continue higher was significant.266 DiNapoli Levels
CHART 15-12

Chapter 15 More Market Examples - 267
Also, any profit objective on a long entry would have to be close. The bottom line was
that the risk/reward ratio just wasn't positive enough for me to get involved. Given these
facts, my focus was on the bond market, since the day trading opportunities there were
much more favorable.
After a good day trading the bond market, I took another look at the S&P. It was about
14:15 to 14:30. The high stood at 52745, clearly in the highly overbought range. I
noticed that by 14:00 both the MACD and Stochastic on the half-hour chart were in a sell
mode and the Stochastic on the hourly was also in a sell. The hourly MACD was
approaching a sell. All these facts taken together told me we had an excellent chance for a
rout to the down side before the day ended, catching all the (long side) Johnny-Come-
Latelies unaware. Given the look of the Trend indicators at about 14:15, if it were going
to happen, it would take place soon.
Okay, everything I talked about so far is the context for the trade. This is the kind of
reasoning I go through on each and every trade. It is how I evaluate my risk/reward. It is
how I determine whether or not I want to play a given market. The bottom line was that I
had strong downtrends forming on intraday charts after reaching a significant Overbought
level.
TRADE PSYCHOLOGY:
Before getting into the details of entry and exit, let's evaluate the psychology of the
market at this point in time.
Long side players have been rewarded day after day. Many have doubled and tripled up
positions attempting to make millions out of a few thousand. Few participants are using
profit objectives: after all, the books tell you to let your profits run, to let the market take
you out. Some players are so confident, they've thrown In a stop and gone to the golf
course. Others who have gotten out at a nice profit are so frustrated at the profits they've
"lost" (greed), that they have gotten back in with larger positions to "make up for" their
"error" in getting out too soon.

MARKET MECHANICS:
If you know anything about market mechanics, you'll know that by midday there are a
bazillion stops under the low of the day at 52230. You also should know that's the area
where the locals will be gunning for stops if we get any kind of Movement south. To
make that last statement more understandable, here's what happens. They (the locals) sell
the market mercilessly on the way down and when the sell stops are hit, they buy them,
after, and during the panic, thereby getting flat and achieving a nice profit. Where do you
think all the Mercedes, Jags, and BMWs come from in the MERC'S parking garage? It's
their job to facilitate trade, provide a liquid market, and buy Mercedes, Jags and BMWs.
Traders off the floor don't realize it's our job to join in with them. So here's how we do
it.

CHART 15-15
Let's assume you've looked at this trade late in the day, as I did. Notice, you had a little
Wash and Rinse at Point 3 '*', another encouraging sign to the down side. By the time it
was 14:30, a strong down wave had developed. FibNodes™ Focus and Reaction
Numbers are labeled on Chart 15-15. Notice the Confluence area 52467-52480. Selling a

Selling "K" was an ideal and "safe" area to take a shot at the down side. You could select
any one of a number of "Bushes" stops, but at a minimum I'd hide my stop above the
'*'.382 Node at 52501. There would also be nothing wrong with selling the first Node
back (box 1) at 52423; instead of the Confluence area. It depends upon how aggressive
you are. I chose to sell at the lower end of Confluence at 52465 and also to sell stop the
low at the Focus Number F, 52350 (chart Point B). While I normally don't initiate orders
on stops, i chose to do so in this case, because I knew there would be some locals and
intraday players closing short positions (buying) at the old lows 52350, 52320, and 52230.
I also knew my broker commanded enough respect in the pit to get me filled reasonably
well, if any of these buy orders manifested.
While my minimum expectation for the trade was to take out the low of the day at 52230,
I quickly calculated the expansion down, which yielded an OP at 52070. This expansion is
detailed in Chart 15-16 and shown in the accompanying FibNodes printout.

Why did I choose the OP? Well, the COP was just below the low of the day and that's
where all the sell stops were. If we hit that point there was no way the COP would hold.
The XOP at 51826 was a mile away and I reasoned that before reaching it there was likely
to be a throw back rally. The OP was most likely to be hit by the simple process of
elimination.
Let's look at the way the trade worked out. The Confluence area, where my initial sell
order was placed was hit to the tick at 52465. What's more interesting, however; is the
second entry at 52350. )
CHART 15-17
ADVANCED COMMENTS:
Notice the time and sales2 Chart 15-17 and the way the market fell. From 52390 at 15:06
to 52335 at 15:07 there wasn't an up tick. Exchange rules say you aren't due a fill until
you get an up tick (on a sell). That happened at 15:08 at 52340. That's where my second
order was tilled, at 35. Now look at the action several minutes later. Note 15:12. We go
from 52300 to 52190 in one tick! We continue with the glide ratio of an anvil to the
52100 area. It's no accident support finally came in 30 points above the OP! Let's take
another look at the five minute Chart 15-16. You'll see the test of the 52100 low was at

displayed. It was what I was using to trade. Appendix H shows time and sales, gathered after the heat of
battle, from a different "more reliable" source. It's interesting to note the difference.

52075, just one tick above the OP! What happened was that the 52100 test, down to
52075, was just enough to wash out the stops below 52100 and reach solid support at the
OP. So how did I handle it?
When I saw the tick from 300 to 190, it was Pampers® time! Hundred point ticks
weren't all that common at the time. I called the floor to see if the tick was correct. Their
voices were hoarse and shaky. The order clerks told me there was a trade or two between
those two numbers, but that a panic was occurring. "We're not 'arbing' orders, it's so
crazy," was what the clerk said. The noise level was extreme. The clerks were concerned
with errors, and rightfully so. Before I got off the phone we were at 52100 and since that
was just a few ticks above my closing profit objective, and since there was a panic going
on, I "canceled replaced" and closed at market. Many of my students and my trading
friends would have been delighted to see a 110 point tick in their favor. For me it was the
ticket out. That old saying about Fools and Angels ought to hang on your trading room
wall.
When I know I'm trading really well and in tune with the market, this is the way things go.
Hit the market on an extreme in a throw back rally, never suffer pain, and take profit in
just a few bars. If you think that this sounds just too good to be true, use these strategies
for a while and see for yourself just how close you can get to the "perfect trade." It might
surprise you.
A QUESTION:
This sounds fantastic. Do you always trade like this?
Sure... I always sell highs, I always buy lows, my stops are never hit, I own Chicago and
New York. My bid is in for Singapore and I'm looking for a retracement!

EPILOGUE
For those of you who are wondering about what became of Hank, Dan, and Carl, I'll fill
you in on what I know.
Hank's still hard at it. He's a broker now and has an advisory service. His clients last
longer than most who trade futures, but they sure seem to trade a lot.
Carl gave up futures trading and runs a nursery specializing in petunias. He managed to
make some money trading, but it was too stressful and considering the amount of work
and worry it entailed it just wasn't worthwhile. His strawberry petunia display won a
blue ribbon at the county fair.
What about Dan?
We'll, he kept slipping through the rain drops and made a lot of money in Futures. For
those jealous ones among you, take heart. After one of his frequent trips to Bangkok, his
wife filed for divorce and the settlement was a doozie. Problem was however, she's been
unable to collect. Something about offshore banks.... He sure is a tough guy to tag.
He's still trading but nobody knows for sure where he is.

Appendix 275
APPENDIX A
CALCULATIONS AND CHART LOCATION FOR THE 3X3 DISPLACED
MOVING AVERAGE
DEFINITION:
The 3X3 Displaced Moving Average is a number which is derived by computing the three
day simple Moving Average of the close, and displacing it forward in time three days. A
series of these numbers, connected together, form a Trend Indicator, as well as a tool for
determining certain directional signals.
EXAMPLE:
If we start with 95/06/12, we can calculate the 3X3 for the Sept. S&P on 95/06/19.
We simply add the closing price on 6/12 to the closing price on 6/13. To that sum we add
the closing price on 6/14. We then divide that total by three. This is what is commonly
known as the simple 3 day Moving Average of the close. Conventional wisdom would
place that number on the chart on 95/06/14. We "displace" it forward 3 (market) days.
Therefore the number calculated represents the 3X3 DMA for 95/06/19.
